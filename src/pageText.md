>Our Process

Making the loving decision to say goodbye is the most difficult thing we do for our pets. It is our goal to make this day easier in any way. Prior to the appointment, Dr. Karen will call and talk a little bit about what is going on with your pet. This will allow her to make a plan that fits your family best. In most cases your pet will be sedated with a quick under-the-skin injection that allows them to relax and fall asleep. The final injection does need to go into a vein. Everything used is a form of anesthesia and pain medication. Our hope is that your pet will fall asleep gently, and after the final medication they will say their forever goodbye. 

The only thing you can do to physically prepare is have a space picked out that you would like to be in. We only need a small area so that everyone can be around the pet. Usually a living room or outside space works well, but we can usually adapt to wherever makes you and your pet most comfortable.

>About Us

Mankato Pet End of Life Services is a small privately run company owned by Dr. Karen Exline since 2019. Dr. Karen graduated from the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine in 2013 and then moved to Minnesota to be close to family. Her career started in a mixed animal practice that provided country calls, including in home euthanasias. During this time Dr. Karen was able to see the peace that this service provided to both the family and pets and wanted to be able to help as many families as possible provide this gentle goodbye. She currently works part time in clinics with dogs and cats as well as providing in home euthanasias. 

>Aftercare Services

We understand that saying goodbye to your beloved pet is the hardest thing you have to do as a pet owner, and we strive to make this process as easy as possible. I partner with Mankato Pet Cremation (Mankatopetcremation.com) for all aftercare cremation needs. When cremation is elected, Wendy will be present during the euthanasia. This allows us to arrive together, fill out the necessary paperwork and take care of payment all at once. After your pet has passed we will take our bags to the car to give you a few minutes alone and return with a stretcher or blanket so your pet can be brought to her local facility. Home burial is also an option as long as all county, city and/or HOA requirements are followed.
